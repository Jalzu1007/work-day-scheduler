# work-day-scheduler

## Description
The Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It uses the Day.js library to work with date and time.

The motivation behind this project was to create a useful tool for employees with busy schedules to manage their time effectively. It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface to schedule important events throughout the day.

The Work Day Scheduler provides a visual representation of the user's day and allows them to easily add and edit events in a timely manner. It helps the user to keep track of their schedule and plan their workday more efficiently.

Through this project, I learned how to use jQuery to dynamically update HTML and CSS based on user interaction. I also learned how to work with date and time using the Day.js library.
